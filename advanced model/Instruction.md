# The instruction of the models
In this folder, we have three models. MODEL_ori_abs is trained by original U-net, while MODEL_edge_abs and MODEL_edge_real is obtained by edge-to-edge training method.
For them, model MODEL_edge_abs is trained by abs-phase data pair, while MODEL_edge_real is trained by real-imag data pair obtained in high frequency image domain.
